        <h3>About İstanbul</h3>
        <p>Expanding the ancient Greek colony of Byzantium by the order of the Roman Emperor Constantine the Great, the imperial city of Constantinople for nearly a thousand years was the last remaining outpost of the Roman Empire. It was finally conquered by the Ottoman Sultan Mehmed II in 1453, an event sometimes used to mark the end of the Middle Ages. By the mid 1500s, Istanbul, with a population of almost half a million, was a major cultural, political, and commercial center. Ottoman rule continued until it was defeated in WWI and Istanbul was occupied by the allied forces. When the Republic of Turkey was born in 1923 after the War of Independence, Kemal Atatürk moved its capital to the city of Ankara. However, Istanbul has continued to expand dramatically; today its population is approximately 16 million. It continues to be a city that creates its own history at the intersection where both continents meet.</p>
